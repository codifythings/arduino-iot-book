# Building Arduino Projects for the Internet of Things
This repository provides complete source code for the book **["Building Arduino Projects for the Internet of Things"](http://codifythings.com)**.

## What This Book Covers
This book is based on my personal experience of getting started with IoT. It is divided into two logical sections. The first one teaches the basics of building IoT applications and the second section follows a project-based approach. At the end of each chapter you will have a working prototype of an IoT application.

### Part 1: Building Blocks
Chapters 1-3 cover the building blocks of IoT:

- **Chapter 1, “Arduino Basics,”** introduces the Arduino prototyping platform, which is used throughout the book.
- **Chapter 2, “Internet Connectivity,”** discusses the different options available for connecting things to the Internet.
- **Chapter 3, “Communication Protocols,”** teaches you which communication protocols are and which ones are available for IoT.

### Part 2: Prototypes
Chapters 4-12 use the information covered in Part 1 to build prototypes of IoT applications.

- **Chapter 4, “Complex Flows: Node-RED,”** introduces Node-RED, which is a visual designer that helps reduce the amount of code required for IoT applications.
- **[Chapter 5, “IoT Patterns: Realtime Clients,”](http://codifythings.com/2016/06/21/intrusion-detection-system/)** talks about components required for building IoT applications that provide data to users in real time and shows you how to build an intrusion detection system as an example.
- **[Chapter 6, “IoT Patterns: Remote Control,”](http://codifythings.com/2016/06/21/lighting-control-system/)** discusses components of IoT applications that can remotely control things, such as a lighting control system.
- **[Chapter 7, “IoT Patterns: On-Demand Clients,”](http://codifythings.com/2016/06/21/smarter-parking-system/)** shows you different components involved in building an on-demand IoT application. You’ll build a smarter parking system in this chapter.
- **[Chapter 8, “IoT Patterns: Web Apps,”](http://codifythings.com/2016/06/21/temperature-monitoring-system/)** teaches you scenarios where web clients are preferred and uses a temperature monitoring system as an example.
- **[Chapter 9, “IoT Patterns: Location-Aware Devices,”](http://codifythings.com/2016/06/21/livestock-tracking-system/)** discusses importance of location-aware devices. You’ll develop a livestock tracking system as an example.
- **[Chapter 10, “IoT Patterns: Machine to Human,”](http://codifythings.com/2016/06/21/waste-management-system/)** talks about scenarios where human response is needed; you’ll build a waste management system as an example.
- **[Chapter 11, “IoT Patterns: Machine to Machine,”](http://codifythings.com/2016/06/21/energy-conservation-system/)** discusses a pattern of IoT that is going to be very popular as things get smarter. The example is an energy conservation system.
- **[Chapter 12, “IoT Platforms,”](http://codifythings.com/2016/06/21/iot-platforms-xively/)** wraps up the book by introducing you to IoT platforms that help expedite entry into IoT. The example in this chapter builds a soil moisture control system.
